# Particle Graph Guide

## Overview
`ParticleGraph` is an open source library for constructing particle physics models and their `FeynRules` file implementation in `Mathematica`. The library is designed to impose a syntax on the model-building such that a self-consistent and experimentally testable model can be proposed and tested automatically by Artificial intelligences or human users. 

## Model Structure
In `ParticleGraph`, a particle physics model is constructed from the following components:
- Gauge Groups
- Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV)
- Particles
- Multiplets
- Dynamical terms and interactions
- Lagrangian

The current version of `ParticleGraph` is designed to construct the Standard Model and its minimal extensions. We fix the Gauge Group, Higgs Sector, and vev, for now, to explore various fermionic structures.
